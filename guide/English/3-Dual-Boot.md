# Windows on the Lg G8x

## Dual Boot

  First restore the boot copy you made before and boot android

  And in magisk install as a module the [uefi installer](https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-msm/actions/runs/4165267962) (It has to be decompressed once, otherwise it will give an error)

## Note

  Sometimes Android won't boot, don't worry, just go back to your previous backup of boot_a and boot_b with Qfil and reinstall the uefi installer
